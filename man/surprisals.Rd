\usage{
surprisals(object, ...)

surprisals_prob(
  object,
  approximation = c("none", "gpd", "empirical"),
  threshold_probability = 0.1,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A model or numerical data set}

\item{...}{Other arguments are passed to the appropriate method.}

\item{approximation}{Character string specifying the approximation to use in
computing the surprisal probabilities. Ignored if \code{probability = FALSE}.
\code{approximation = "none"} specifies that no approximation is to be used;
\code{approximation = "gpd"} specifies that  the Generalized Pareto distribution should be used;
while \code{approximation = "empirical"} specifies that the probabilities should be estimated empirically.}

\item{threshold_probability}{Probability threshold when computing the GPD
approximation. This is the probability below which the GPD is fitted. Only
used if \code{approximation = "gpd"} and \code{probability = TRUE}).}
}
\value{
A numerical vector containing the surprisals or surprisal probabilities.
}
\description{
A surprisal is given by \eqn{s = -\log f(y)} where \eqn{f} is the
density or probability mass function of the estimated or assumed distribution,
and \eqn{y} is an observation. This is returned by \code{surprisals()}.
A surprisal probability is the probability of a surprisal at least as extreme
as \eqn{s}. This is returned by \code{surprisals_prob()}

The surprisal probabilities may be computed in three different ways.
\enumerate{
\item Given the same distribution that was used to compute the surprisal values.
Under this option, surprisal probabilities are equal to 1 minus the
coverage probability of the largest HDR that contains each value. Surprisal
probabilities smaller than 1e-6 are returned as 1e-6.
\item Using a Generalized Pareto Distribution fitted to the most extreme
surprisal values (those with probability less than \code{threshold_probability}).
This option is used if \code{approximation = "gpd"}. For surprisal probabilities
greater than \code{threshold_probability}, the value of
\code{threshold_probability} is returned. Under this option, the distribution is
used for computing the surprisal values but not for determining their
probabilities. Due to extreme value theory, the resulting probabilities should
be relatively insensitive to the distribution used in computing the surprisal
values.
\item Empirically as the proportion of observations with greater surprisal values.
This option is used when \code{approxiation = "empirical"}. This is also
insensitive to the distribution used in computing the surprisal values.
